INFO 4320/5321: Introduction to Rapid Prototyping and Physical Computing (Fall 2022, Spring 2023, Fall 2023)
----------
**Teaching Assistant at Cornell University, Instructor: Prof. Cheng Zhang**

This class is for both undergraduate and graduate students at Cornell with different backgrounds. My responsibilities as a TA were to hold office hours and project meetings with students to help them address the problems they encountered during individual assignments and group projects. The problems were usually related to a wide range of topics in rapid prototyping and physical computing including 3D printing, laser cutting, microcontrollers, sensors, and motors. Besides, I also provided grades and feedback on the students’ assignments and project reports together with other TAs.

INFO 4120/6120: Ubiquitous Computing (Fall 2021)
----------
**Teaching Assistant at Cornell University, Instructor: Prof. Cheng Zhang**

**Nominated for Outstanding Teaching Award**

This class is for both undergraduate and graduate students at Cornell with different backgrounds. As the only TA, my responsibilities were to hold office hours and project meetings with students to help them address the problems they encountered during individual assignments and group projects. The problems were usually related to a wide range of topics in ubiquitous computing including 3D printing, microcontrollers, sensors, signal processing (Java) and machine learning. Besides, I also provided grades and feedback on the students’ assignments and project reports.
