In my spare time, I like playing all kinds of sports (tennis, basketball, rock climbing, badminton, table tennis, ...). In Ithaca, I hike in the summers and ski in the winters.

During holidays, I am enthusastic about traveling and exploring the world. Apart from my home country China, Thailand is my favorite country among all the countries I have visited.

I am also a big fan of Nintendo Switch and play lots of games on it for entertainment. Among all these games, The Legend of Zelda is the BEST game ever!
