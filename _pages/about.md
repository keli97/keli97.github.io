* I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at [SciFi Lab](https://www.scifilab.org/) in College of Computing and Information Science at Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Cheng Zhang](https://czhang.org/). My current research interests cover a wide range of ubiquitous computing, sensing systems, wearable devices, and AI. My work have been published in a series of top-tier conferences, including UbiComp, MobiCom, CHI, ISWC, and IPSN. 

* I am a winner of the [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2024-north-america) 2024. Check out my [Student Spotlight](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/spotlights/student-spotlight-ke-li/) at Cornell Graduate School!

* I graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Information Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), P.R. China, where I was awarded the National Scholarship twice. I am one of the Outstanding Graduates in Shanghai.

<!--In my sophomore year, I joined [Advanced Network Laboratory](http://anl.sjtu.edu.cn/) as a research assistant, advised by [Prof. Guihai Chen](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen/) and [Prof. Xiaofeng Gao](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~gao-xf/). In the summer of my junior year, I went to the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and became a summer intern under the guidance of [Prof. Swarun Kumar](http://www.swarunkumar.com/). In my senior year, I joined [Intelligent Internet of Things (IIOT) Research Center](http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/index.html) to complete my graduation thesis with the supervisor [Prof. Xiaohua Tian](http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/xtian/).-->

<!--* Previously, my research mainly focused on Networks and Systems, including network optimization, wireless network, crowdsourcing, and D2D communication network. I have published two papers about clustering problems in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) of Internet of Things (IoT) in [Transactions on Wireless Communications (TWC)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8765348) and [the 48th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP 2019)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3337821.3337926) respectively. -->
