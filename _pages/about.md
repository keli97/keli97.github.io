* I am pursuing Bachelor's Degree in [School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering](http://www.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), P.R. China. In my sophomore year, I joined [Advanced Network Laboratory](http://anl.sjtu.edu.cn/) as a research assistant, advised by [Prof. Guihai Chen](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen/) and [Prof. Xiaofeng Gao](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~gao-xf/). During the summer vacation of my junior year, I went to the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/) and became a summer intern under the guidance of [Prof. Swarun Kumar](http://www.swarunkumar.com/). In my senior year, I joined [Intelligent Internet of Things (IIOT) Research Center](http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/index.html) to complete my graduation thesis with the supervisor [Prof. Xiaohua Tian](http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/xtian/).

* My research interests cover a wide range of Networks and Systems, including network optimization, wireless network, crowdsourcing, and D2D communication network. I have published two papers about clustering problems in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) of Internet of Things (IoT) in [Transactions on Wireless Communications (TWC)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8765348) and [the 48th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP 2019)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3337821.3337926) respectively.
