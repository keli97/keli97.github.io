![avatar](https://keli97.github.io/files/cv_header.jpeg)

* I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in School of Computing and Information Science at Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Cheng Zhang](https://www.scifilab.org/). My current research interests cover a wide range of ubiquitous computing, sensing systems, wearable devices, and HCI.

* I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), P.R. China. 

<!--In my sophomore year, I joined [Advanced Network Laboratory](http://anl.sjtu.edu.cn/) as a research assistant, advised by [Prof. Guihai Chen](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen/) and [Prof. Xiaofeng Gao](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~gao-xf/). In the summer of my junior year, I went to the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and became a summer intern under the guidance of [Prof. Swarun Kumar](http://www.swarunkumar.com/). In my senior year, I joined [Intelligent Internet of Things (IIOT) Research Center](http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/index.html) to complete my graduation thesis with the supervisor [Prof. Xiaohua Tian](http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/xtian/).-->

<!--* Previously, my research mainly focused on Networks and Systems, including network optimization, wireless network, crowdsourcing, and D2D communication network. I have published two papers about clustering problems in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) of Internet of Things (IoT) in [Transactions on Wireless Communications (TWC)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8765348) and [the 48th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP 2019)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3337821.3337926) respectively. -->
