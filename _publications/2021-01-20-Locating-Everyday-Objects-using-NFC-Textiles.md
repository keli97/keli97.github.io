* Proposed a localization system design of a MIMO-enabled NFC reader which locates surrounding NFC tags as well as untagged conductive objects.
* The system achieved few centimeter-accurate location tracking of both tagged and untagged objects in proximity.
* The approach achieved an overall range of 20 cm of location tracking from the textile NFC reader.
