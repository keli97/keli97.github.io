* Improved Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (DEEC) algorithm with energy constraints and cluster coverage ranges of sensors in 3-dimensional WSNs taken into consideration.
* Adopted Q-learning scheme to choose cluster heads for routing packets of each sensor.
* Solved the Energy-Efficient Clustering Problem (EECP), which is an NP-Complete problem in the running time O(kX), where k is the cluster number and X is the number of updates that Q-learning needs to converge.
* Conducted experiments with the algorithm and outperformed k-means clustering and an FCM-based algorithm in terms of network lifespan, packet delivery rate, and transmission latency.
