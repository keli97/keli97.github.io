* Designed a scheme to select cluster heads for a homogeneous network in a three-dimensional situation based on the concept of d-hop connected dominating set.
* Proposed a distributed approximation algorithm and proved its approximation ratio.
* Conducted numerical experiments with 100 nodes randomly distributed in a three-dimensional Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to analyze and prove the efficiency of the algorithm.
